### dev.

Over 8 years of professional development working with teams ranging from 2 to 200 people in small to corporate businesses. A most recent accomplishment is providing a working e-commerce solution for a $9B popular publicly traded company and managing their store program. Currently, I'm on a team with excellent developers working on an AWS S3 alternative. See https://xanetservices.com/ for more details.

### geek.

Anything related to development or performed on a PC, I'm interested.

### crypto.

Blockchain technology will take the lead in enterprise businesses in the future. Currently, with blockchain, you can do a multitude of functions, like transact money, store information and even file storage. I have invested quite a bit of time learning these technologies and have quite a few projects to be released!
