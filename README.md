Anything related to development or performed on a PC, I'm interested.

### crypto.

Blockchain technology will take the lead in enterprise businesses in the future. Currently, with blockchain, you can do a multitude of functions, like transact money, store information and even file storage. I have invested quite a bit of time learning these technologies and have quite a few projects to be released!
