### dev.

I'm a developer. I'm not a writer. I can write good code. I can not write good bios.

I primarily develop applications, both web and desktop, using Javascript based frameworks such as React. Currently, the majority of projects I have started have used NextJS (since v9) as it has proven itself to be a top-notch easy to scale framework. 

### geek.

Often I find myself enjoying a technical article much like a reader who enjoys a good mystery novel. Learning how companies overcome obstacles by changing, improving or re-developing technology stacks allows me to take that knowledge and use it however I wish! 

### blockchain.

Blockchain technology will take the lead in enterprise businesses in the future. Currently, with blockchain, you are able to transact money, store information (databasing), and even store files. As we all continue to develop and explore the world of blockchain, more functionality will come proving the need for this technology on a global scale.
